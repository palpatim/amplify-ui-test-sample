# amplify-ui-test-sample

Demonstrates Amplify running with UITests

Shorthand steps to set up the project:

- `pod install`
- `amplify init`
- `amplify add auth`

This will create an `amplifyconfiguration.json` file in the root of your project folder. The project is already set up to reference it.

Then run the UI tests as normal.
